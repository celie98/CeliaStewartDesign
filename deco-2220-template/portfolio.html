          <p>Our final application is aimed to improve the current context of finding and helping people who get lost at the snow. The applications goal is to provide a service using a search, delivery first aid drone - that is more efficient, safe and productive compared to methods used today. The application is for the person who are lost on the slopes. The skier will have a GPS, signal tracker in their ski pass. The signal goes off when it detects unnatural behaviour. The first aid drone will detect the signal and follow it to the person who seems in distress. The drone will ask if the person needs assistance – if they say no it will fly away, if they say yes it will land with a first aid kit and if no response it will automatically send a video, alert to the ski patrol. In cases where the person does need help the person will take off the interface on the drone where it provides features to calm, medicate and destress the individual like weather reports, breathing exercises, medical assistance, how to use the medical kit, calling a friend/ ski patrol or paramedic, GPS of Ski patrol and What to do when. The application will have alerts saying if there is threatening weather conditions or how long the patrol is. Our application gives all the essential information to the person who is lost to relax the individual until they are rescued.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>Over the course, our design went through four phrases of the design process discover, define, develop and deliver to grow an idea into a satisfactory user interface high fidelity prototype. </p>

        </div>

         <div class="col-md-6">
          <h5>DISCOVER</h5>
<p>Starting the design process as a group of three we all brainstormed various contexts for drones or autonomous mobiles. After brainstorming we created a stakeholder map for each of the contexts to get a deeper understanding of the target audience. We all collaborated ideas and decided that we will go into more depth of the problem context of the snow. Each team member conducted separate secondary research to grow a greater understanding of the chosen context and the opportunities that arise using autonomous mobiles. The overall findings that came from the research was when it comes to finding someone in the snow there is room of improvement. The current methods use a lot of resources, not precious, time it took when someone’s health is at risk and the expense. With this we narrowed our context to people in need at the snow.

<div class="col-md-6">
          <h5>DEFINE</h5>
<p>After narrowing down the opportunity context we developed a range of research questions. We aimed to answer the research questions through primary research. I choose that emailing ski patrol and emergency services a questionnaire and creating a survey for people who go to the ski. This gave me a broad range of data from both the main stakeholders. The questionnaire and surveys gave useful quantitative data that was then put into an affinity diagram helping understand what features the ski patrol and lost person needs in the interface. The information gave huge insight in the potential of using how delivery/ first aid drones.  As a group we then brainstormed the different concepts from the research gained could help our context.

<div class="col-md-6">
           <h5>DEVELOP</h5>
<p>We started developing our idea with initial sketches and annotations to test various different sets up for the user interfaces to then creating low-fidelity prototypes and putting them into the application Pop to test them on users. We used the testing techniques post questionnaires and Observation. We received a lot of insights of the alterations that we needed to adjust and improve. After the feedback we redefined the low-fidelity prototype and created a mid-fidelity prototype using sketch. When we were happy with the product, we put it into Invision to test the same methods on different users. We also received a lot of feedback from our tutor.  We again found a lot of design features that needed to be improved to make the interface more straightforward and efficient. We tested different colour palettes to see which was the most aesthetically pleasing to the design then asked different people what they preferred. Finally from all the redefining from the feedback we finally developed a user interface that we thought had a sound flow, design layout and functional.

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>Throughout the design process there were numerous, major changes to the initial design - to create the final. From the research, the current methods require the ski patrol to ask questions to understand the situation before going searching - this lead  to asking the questions for the ski patrol before people got to access the features. The questions seemed too much like a survey whilst calling was more efficient and desired for a person in a stressed situation. The features in the interface changed with initially having the recreation function that we thought was a good idea for the person to use to keep company. After feedback - watching movies or playing games seemed impractical and not important in the snow in an emergency situation, so we decided to get rid of it. We changed the order hierarchy so the more important functions were at the top and we also changed the titles of the functions to make it more clear for the user eg, stress to stress relief. We altered the colour scheme to make the interface more appealing and functional with the important buttons standing out like the menu button. The medical page became more precise with the layout being grids of categories to the person either call a paramedic or tapping on where they are hurt. Through the numerous changes, the interface is easy to navigate around and creates an relievant service. </p>

  <p>
Overall the initial designs and ideas are completely different to the final mock ups. The changes are from the design process of using the received feedback and redefining to create a more functional interface with a successful flow. Our aim was to create a user interface that was simple and had an easy to flow for the lost person who is stressed. The process was long and at times challenging but in the end,  I believe our group fulfilled our goals to form a practical and aesthetic design that improves the initial context.
