                <h5><strong>WEEK 1-</strong></h5>
          <p>We were introducing to the objective and design brief of the semester. To start we learned about visual interfaces and defining the approaches to design with user experience and user centred design in the lecture and about the assessments that is required. We were put with Aarons to be our studio mentor and then formed groups. In the tutorial we did sketches iterations of sketching different door models and then to drawing different types of buttons. In this is was an example of difference between graphic design </p>

                <p>Design is not only how it looks but also how it feels and overall how the design works. We identified and defined design.We identified and defined design. The next activity was to design and reframe a microwave for kids and present the ideas. We were put with Aarons to be our studio mentor and formed groups we will be with for the rest of the semester. This week set us up for what we will expect for this semester and gave us an understanding on the design brief and where to start</p>

               <h5><strong>WEEK 2</strong></h5>
          <p> The following week we developed a deeper understanding of our design brief and what are autonomous mobiles and drones. We talked about what they will do and how they will change society in the future. Not only did we see the advantages of them with the efficiency and easier way of life they will provided for us but also despite how they already exist today, Autonomous mobiles still have huge design problems such as the limitations on weather, legal laws and so on. </p>
          
           <p>In the tutorial we took apart and defined the stages of the design process. The four main phases of the design project are discover – the planning and observing to understanding the scenario and problem to are designing to solve , define – exploration and research to define the core problems that needs to be addressed, develop – collaboration, prototyping and testing, Collaborating discover and define to come up concepts then working and testing the concepts on the stakeholders and deliver to develop a robust solution, deliver -refining and communicating the idea and design.We learnt how to do stakeholder mapping, which is an activity in the discovery phase to help identify and scope the problem area. We then did a target audience activity to narrow down the specific group of people</p>

          <p> In the studio session as a group we came up with three individual ideas and areas. Tom wanted to look into delivery drones in the area of medical, Zhou looked into food deliver autonomous vehicles and I looked into the snow context and people needing help. With that we did our own stakeholder map and talk and refined each person’s ideas. </p>
              
        
        <p>I looked into through secondary research what processes right now are used to find and help someone at the snow. With the current methods of finding someone by helicopters, GPS, investigating when last seen, emergency services and ski patrol doing a sweep pattern there was major problems with the amount of resources used, the expense, the time it took with someone’s health at risk and also the uncertainty of where the person actually is which lead a lot of problem scenario which using drones could be beneficial. </p>

                <h5><strong>WEEK 3</strong></h5> 
<p>This week we identified the “User Research was a systematic approach to understanding people’s behaviours and needs to create useful, usable and desirable experiences.” We went into depth about the stages of the User research. We looked into what research questions and goals are and how they will be achieved by the multitude of different research methods and then using the information gathered by the methods and analysing it to summarize the found insights and conclusions. </p>

<p>In the studio, we broke down the components of the research plan in more depth. We came up with our own research questions for a design brief called Cooking Tech. After that we designed our own research plan and presented it for Cooking tech. </p>

<p>In the studio we changed from Sean’s group to Wills group and got told that instead of each person in our group to have three different contexts to research that we should all choose one of the three. We brainstormed various ideas of being in the context of the snow and problems spaces which could be improved by autonomous vehicles such as driving on icy roads, people getting lost in the mountains, handicapped people who are unable to ski without having people leading them and being injured at the top of the mountain. As a group, we decided to go with helping someone who is lost at the snow context because we also a lot of potential from secondary research in how methods can be improve with efficiency, costly and safety. We narrowed down the context looking into delivery drone and being lost and then came up with a multitude of research questions and then narrow down to five that we thought we should all answer in our research plan. </p> 

<ol>1.How do most people become lost in the first place? </ol>
          <ol>2.What uses could the snow patrol have using a drone? </ol>
          <ol>3.How do people react when they are lost? </ol>
<ol>4.What technology do people have with them when they are skiing/ how do people signal for help? </ol>
          <ol>5.How do people know what to do when they are lost? </ol> 


<p>After that we wanted each person to use different research methods in their research plans. After each research question we came up with a couple of research methods that would be the best fitting in answering the question. I used a questionnaire and an online survey. </p>

<p>Through the research method of emailing different Ski Patrol, emergency services and rescue squads long answered responses in what happens when someone is lost in a remote area. I found a lot of interesting results and saw a lot of potential in how using delivery, search drones could improve the experience of being lost at the snow. Found out information about how different circumstances results to different search parties and the procedures that the Ski patrol undergo before going on the search like contracting people who had last seen the lost people for general information about intentions, where they were last seen, state of mind, clothing etc. This gave me good insight in what the drone needs to find out first and send to the ski patrol. Also helped know what health risk were at hand when an individual was found in this situation and what should be in the first aid kit </p>

              </div>
          </div>

<p>The survey tested people who would be in a situation to be lost and how they would react being lost. The survey helped understand how many individuals don’t know first aid or what to do when lost. This came up with the idea of having a what to do when... page and a first aid instruction feature. We understood what people feel when they are lost and that all they want is someone there to comfort, so we tried to give features on the first aid kit to comfort and reduce their stress. We tried to come up with features for the first aid kit to make being lost as pleasant as possible.</p>

<p>Using the affinity diagram from the research material the three topics I wanted thought had to be achieved in the User Interface and drone were 
<ol>• Something familiar and reassuring can reduce panicking when lost </ol>
<ol>• Procedures of what to do when being lost and in first aid needs to be more educated</ol>
<ol>• Asking questions helps narrow how the person got lost and how can we gain this information from drone?</ol>

<p> From the information I formed two storyboards and two personas about the situation now and what would happen.

               <h5><strong>WEEK 4 </strong></h5>
 <p>In the lecture we learnt about the Internet of Things. In how ordinary things are enhanced with technological advancements becomes an extraordinary creation. We learnt about the different IoT products that are coming into market and how successful and unsuccessful they are. It’s important listening and testing the product on users are and how connecting services and products to a network can be great but also can make the product seem broken.</p> 
<p>In the tutorial we brainstormed our everyday objects that we used at home and choose one to anthropomorphise it giving our object a personality. With sketching. Acting and presenting our object came to life. Then we did it with objects that we use in our project, creating 2 personas. With this exercise it was making the experience of my connected devices coherent. </p>
<p>In the studio, we presented our reports and listened to everyone else’s. We got given feedback from the tutor and collaborated my groups individual research and our findings. Afterwards, we collaborated in a group of all our main research findings and ideas

                <h5><strong>WEEK 5 </strong></h5>
                 <p>In the lecture we learnt about the importance of communicating our designs to others and ourselves. We learnt about the different wireframes and the important techniques you should include to be able to create a coherent wireframe. </p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <p>In the tutorial, we got given a user case scenario and designed a storyboard and interfaces using pros and cons, annotations, colour important areas, questions things you need to answer. This exercise gave a clearer understanding of how to present a clear storyboard. We then refined our ideas and gave us a template to put together a pitch </p>
<div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-12">
   <p>In the studio we all came together with our ideas and brainstormed several concepts in which we could help someone in the snow lost using a user interface. We came up with 4 main ideas and broadened them you the different features they could have. They were the user interface for the ski patrol to find the person, the user interface for the people who is lost using a delivery, first aid drone, the autonomous snow mobile that comes and picks up the lost, injury people and takes them to safety of the drone that surveys the land for the ski patrol to have a safe route. Then we all each choose a concept to create story boards and wireframes for. I choose the first aid delivery and companion drone. </p>
           
  <p>I started to sketch and annotate using the technique shown in the lecture the storyboard. I found a series of aspect challenging. Firstly, how the drone finds the person, does it fly around surveying and detects someone in trouble but that wasn’t precise in finding the individual? Does the lost skier press a button to send help but then what would happen if the person can’t move? Or is there that the Drones gets a signal without the person having to do anything but how would it get a signal? Secondly, it was challenging in how the drone will get a first kit to match their needs of the user or what will the drone do once it finds the person. I came up with the idea that the drones will receive a signal from the users lift pass when it hasn’t moved for a while or when it is out of the resort and will fly to the user. The drone will fly down and ask if the person needs assistance because the user might not want help and if they do then fly don’t and give the user the interface while it stays there until the ski patrol comes.</p>

                <h5><strong> WEEK 6</strong></h5> 
          <p>In the lecture, we learnt about User interface design patterns and why they are useful. We viewed different websites design patterns like BBC and Commonwealth Bank and seen their different design layouts and their improvements over the years.</p>
<p>In the tutorial, we did activities that evolved around paper prototypes which are user-centred design methods for designer to create user friendly software. Paper prototyping is a low-fidelity and is good for quickly validating design before going to digital prototypes. It is used to refine concepts in the earlier stages. In the tutorial, we learnt different testing methods for the prototype and who is best to test on. Making sure that the tasks for the user interface is successfully achieved. We then create our own prototypes, the tutorial helping defined each task required when doing the prototype. </p>

<p>In the studio, I sketched various different of designs patterns to see what one is the best one and efficient one. I annotated pros and cons, labelled and asked questions that need to be addressed. Through the research the main three things a person needs when lost is comfort, first aid and to reduce stress so by this rom the main topics. I choose the design with the three columns because I thought it was a clear, straight forward, simple design that was easy to use especially for a person who is stressed.</p>

                <h5><strong>WEEK 7</strong></h5>
                <p>In the lecture, we covered the topic of prototyping. We learnt about the different types of prototyping and why it is important (it makes the idea tangible, something that we can get user insight from reactions and enhancing the understanding). Prototyping is good for experimenting and iterate the feedback giving to explore alternate solutions.</p>
<p>In the tutorial, we recreated the Instagram interface design with sketches. We then put our low fidelity sketches into the app pop to create an interactive prototype. We learnt how to use pop and we used the design tool sketch to create an Instagram page then putting it into Invision to create an online prototype. These activities gave us insight in how to use these programs for our own prototypes and the benefits they have.</p>

          <p>In the studio, I started to develop my low fidelity prototype further and sketched all the designs. The first current procedures that the Ski Patrol does when lost is to ask questions. I designed that in the User Interface before asking the main features the lost skier has to answer four questions that will be sent to the ski patrol to understand more about the situation like are you hurt, do you have any medical history. I tried to keep the template as basic and simplistic as possible, so it is easy to navigate. As a group we reviewed everyone designs/ concepts and critiqued them. </p>

          <p> That week I put them into pop and did user testing on the low fidelity prototype. I used the methods Post questionnaire and Observation. I developed a lot of feedback on the design are what alterations needs to be improved. There was a lot of confusion about the what happens to the drone whilst using the device, no one used the language feature, the medical grid is too cluttered and needs to be refined more etc. Through this it gave me insight on the things to adjust for the high fidelity prototypes.I then created a wireflow and annotated all of the insight from the usertesting </p>

                <h5><strong>WEEK 8</strong></h5>
          <p>In the lecture, we explored prototyping further. It was defined in the lecture as “a way of exploring, communicating and testing a vision of a future experience, by making it tangible.” We learnt about the different tools for creating high fidelity prototypes which help us understand what program is best for our prototype. For a successful prototype we learnt about the importance of animation, timing and motion, giving us ideas in how we can make the best possible prototype for ourselves.</p> 

<p>In the tutorial, they taught us the tools of Invision and framer. In Invision they taught us how to use the application to create working and functioning prototype. We used the techniques learnt in the tutorial to create our own. The tutorial was extremely helpful and practical. </p>

<p>In the studio, we came together and consolidated all the feedback that we received in the user testing and brainstormed different features that should go into the User interface and different ways we could approach the design flaws from the research to improve the prototype as best as possible. </p>

<p>From the user feedback, we started to develop the high-fidelity wireframes. The colour blue was chosen because from research it has the effect to calm people down which was our goal. We wanted the interface to be clear and simple, so we added colourful icons that stand out from the grey and for people to get a deeper understanding of the features, limiting the confusion. We add more features into the different categories like movie, games, weather, meditation, call paramedics/ friends and a lot more. We put a search bar in the corner, so the user can access files sooner. From the user research we changed a lot of the layout such as got rid of the slider format in the stressed feature page and made it a grid because from the feedback it showed that the grid was a clearer, to the point layout. We struggled with thinking of ways in how we can simplify and categorise the medical page because the user in the low fidelity page felt that it was too overwhelming and  unstructured with having topics of everybody function and issue so we decided that if the person just taps on the body where they are hurt and then answer a series of questions to narrow down the injury and then say how to help would be the most convent and helpful way. We kept the question section how it was but coloured the different answers. Overall the user research helped immensely to create a more straight forward and efficient user interface.

We the techniques we learnt in week 8 to put our prototype into invision to be able to test it on users. We used the methods of Post questions after going through the prototype and think-aloud testing to receive feedback of strengths and weaknesses on how successful the user interface is. We gathered a lot of various feedback from the questions being too much like a survey and not fitting into an emergency situation, the confusions of the title comfort and stress, the features that were important, the flow wasn’t has smooth with the hidden back button, and the confusion where some of the features were. It was challenging in testing the user interface with people because the people weren’t in a stressful, anxious environment which would change how they would’ve interacted with the prototype. Overall all the user feedback was then taken consider for the next steps of iterations. I then made all the screens into a wire flow to highlight the movement and functions of each button.</p>

                <p>In week 10’s lecture it gave us insight of the jobs opportunities in the field of design and how it is important to mix the skills of a designer and a programmer. This week the reports the due. I felt that as a group we struggled working together. In a lot of the lectures and studios at least one partner was away so when putting all our sketches and designs together everyone had done the task in a different way. We tried to catch up before the report was due three times, but all three times didn’t work out. We presented our reports and got useful insight on the next steps and weaknesses we need to improve on from our tutor groups. The feedback received was useful with the icons being too colourful making the screen busy, the hierarchy of elements needed to be improved especially in a time of stress, there should be an option to call before answering the survey in desperate times and a more defined idea and process. All this feedback was really useful in the next stage of re-iterating the design.</p>

          <h5><strong>WEEK 11</strong></h5>
                <p>This week, in a group re-iterated the different things that had to be changed to create a successful design. We split up into tasks, Zhou was doing the Html of the prototype, I was re-design the different screens and Tom was doing the companion website and testing. To start I want to test different colour palettes to make the interface more appealing to the eye. I tested different things like when you hover over the screen the dull blue button with change colours but then realised that our interface is touch screen, so we couldn’t hover. I made all the icons white and added no background colour, but it made the buttons not look like they work. I came up with a few different designs and asked various people what they preferred. The preferred design was to keep the blue background and have all the icons white. We fiddled around with the hierarchy order putting things most important bigger and at the top of the pages. We decided from the studio and user research to delete the questions at the start and instead make a page asking if they want instant help to call the Ski patrol or self-assist where they can access the feature page. We gave shadows to the buttons to make them clearer. We changed a lot of headings like stress to stress relief, GPS to location of the ski patrol creating a greater understanding of the functions and buttons. We changed a lot of small features to create a more aesthetically pleasing design

          <h5><strong>WEEK 12</strong></h5>
                <p>This week was when the assessments were due, we had a huge challenge that using HTML was a lot of hard work and was a great challenge with time restraints to be able to finish the reiterated high-fidelity prototype in time. Will told us that we didn’t need to use HTML and instead using Indesign studio application was a great and efficient way to put the prototype together and being able to add animations and create a better motion. Sadly, all that work on HTML was thrown out and we had to quickly re-design our sketch prototype to the way we want it and put it into design studio. We also added and iterated from the feedback we received from Will in more things that we should consider about the features of the design. From the feedback we put the stress section into medical section because it comes more under medical attention then having to be a section of its own. We deleted the section of recreational because sitting in the snow when lost watching a movie or reading a book is impractical and isn’t necessary for a rescue drone. With help from the tutor’s input, we decided that calling was one of the biggest essentials and should be on the home screen and it satisfies the goals of comforting someone by contacting help and reassurance. We also changed the heading format, deleted the headings icon and switched the side bar. The heading was taking too much of the screen up and wasn’t aesthetically pleasing to the eye, we made the heading smaller. We deleted the icon in the heading because it was clashing with the side bar and not making it noticed. We added animations like the breathing exercises, the call button changing colour, the side bar sliding in and the notification pop ups making the user interface flow. We gave motion to the slide as when the user presses the button the next page, slides right to make it look over the previous screen and if we wanted to go back the screen would slide left. Overall the user-face design was handed in on time and has been iterated to create a successful application. We went through a lot of challenges but in the end managed to make huge iterations to the user interface that is easy and efficient to comforts, give medical assistance and reduce stress to someone who is lost in the snow. I believe the interface we created is successful in achieving all our initial goals.</p>
