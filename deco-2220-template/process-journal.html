				  <h5><strong>WEEK 1-</strong></h5>
				  <p>We were introducing to the objective and design brief of the semester. To start we learned about visual interfaces and defining the approaches to design with user experience and user centred design in the lecture and about the assessments that is required. We were put with Aarons to be our studio mentor and then formed groups. In the tutorial we did sketches iterations of sketching different door models and then to drawing different types of buttons. In this is was an example of difference between graphic design and design thinking. </p>

                <p>WEEK 2- The following week we developed a deeper understanding of our design brief and what are autonomous mobiles and drones. We talked about what they will do and how they will change society in the future. Not only did we see the advantages of them with the efficiency and easier way of life they will provided for us but also despite how they already exist today, Autonomous mobiles still have huge design problems such as the limitations on weather, legal laws and so on. 
					
					In the tutorial we took apart and defined the stages of the design process. The four main phases of the design project are discover – the planning and observing to understanding the scenario and problem to are designing to solve , define – exploration and research to define the core problems that needs to be addressed, develop – collaboration, prototyping and testing, Collaborating discover and define to come up concepts then working and testing the concepts on the stakeholders and deliver to develop a robust solution, deliver -refining and communicating the idea and design. We learnt how to do stakeholder mapping, which is an activity in the discovery phase to help identify and scope the problem area. We then did a target audience activity to narrow down the specific group of people.
					
					In the studio session as a group we came up with three individual ideas and areas. Tom wanted to look into delivery drones in the area of medical, Zhou looked into food deliver autonomous vehicles and I looked into the snow context and people needing help. With that we did our own stakeholder map and talk and refined each person’s ideas. 
					
					I looked into through secondary research what processes right now are used to find and help someone at the snow. With the current methods of finding someone by helicopters, GPS, investigating when last seen, emergency services and ski patrol doing a sweep pattern there was major problems with the amount of resources used, the expense, the time it took with someone’s health at risk and also the uncertainty of where the person actually is which lead a lot of problem scenario which using drones could be beneficial. </p>

                <p>WEEK 3 – 
This week we identified the “User Research was a systematic approach to understanding people’s behaviours and needs to create useful, usable and desirable experiences.” We went into depth about the stages of the User research. We looked into what research questions and goals are and how they will be achieved by the multitude of different research methods and then using the information gathered by the methods and analysing it to summarize the found insights and conclusions. 

In the studio, we broke down the components of the research plan in more depth. We came up with our own research questions for a design brief called Cooking Tech. After that we designed our own research plan and presented it for Cooking tech. 

In the studio we changed from Sean’s group to Wills group and got told that instead of each person in our group to have three different contexts to research that we should all choose one of the three. We brainstormed various ideas of being in the context of the snow and problems spaces which could be improved by autonomous vehicles such as driving on icy roads, people getting lost in the mountains, handicapped people who are unable to ski without having people leading them and being injured at the top of the mountain. As a group, we decided to go with helping someone who is lost at the snow context because we also a lot of potential from secondary research in how methods can be improve with efficiency, costly and safety. We narrowed down the context looking into delivery drone and being lost and then came up with a multitude of research questions and then narrow down to five that we thought we should all answer in our research plan. 

1.How do most people become lost in the first place? 
2.What uses could the snow patrol have using a drone? 
3.How do people react when they are lost? 
4.What technology do people have with them when they are skiing/ how do people signal for help? 
5.How do people know what to do when they are lost? 


After that we wanted each person to use different research methods in their research plans. After each research question we came up with a couple of research methods that would be the best fitting in answering the question. I used a questionnaire and an online survey. 

Through the research method of emailing different Ski Patrol, emergency services and rescue squads long answered responses in what happens when someone is lost in a remote area. I found a lot of interesting results and saw a lot of potential in how using delivery, search drones could improve the experience of being lost at the snow. Found out information about how different circumstances results to different search parties and the procedures that the Ski patrol undergo before going on the search like contracting people who had last seen the lost people for general information about intentions, where they were last seen, state of mind, clothing etc. This gave me good insight in what the drone needs to find out first and send to the ski patrol. Also helped know what health risk were at hand when an individual was found in this situation and what should be in the first aid kit

The survey tested people who would be in a situation to be lost and how they would react being lost. The survey helped understand how many individuals don’t know first aid or what to do when lost. This came up with the idea of having a what to do when... page and a first aid instruction feature. We understood what people feel when they are lost and that all they want is someone there to comfort, so we tried to give features on the first aid kit to comfort and reduce their stress. We tried to come up with features for the first aid kit to make being lost as pleasant as possible.

Using the affinity diagram from the research material the three topics I wanted thought had to be achieved in the User Interface and drone were 
•	Something familiar and reassuring can reduce panicking when lost
•	Procedures of what to do when being lost and in first aid needs to be more educated
•	Asking questions helps narrow how the person got lost and how can we gain this information from drone?

From the information I formed two storyboards and two personas about the situation now and what would happen.

                <p>WEEK 4 – 
 In the lecture we learnt about the Internet of Things. In how ordinary things are enhanced with technological advancements becomes an extraordinary creation. We learnt about the different IoT products that are coming into market and how successful and unsuccessful they are. It’s important listening and testing the product on users are and how connecting services and products to a network can be great but also can make the product seem broken. 
In the tutorial we brainstormed our everyday objects that we used at home and choose one to anthropomorphise it giving our object a personality. With sketching. Acting and presenting our object came to life. Then we did it with objects that we use in our project, creating 2 personas. With this exercise it was making the experience of my connected devices coherent. 
In the studio, we presented our reports and listened to everyone else’s. We got given feedback from the tutor and collaborated my groups individual research and our findings. Afterwards, we collaborated in a group of all our main research findings and ideas

                <p>In the tutorial, we got given a user case scenario and designed a storyboard and interfaces using pros and cons, annotations, colour important areas, questions things you need to answer. This exercise gave a clearer understanding of how to present a clear storyboard. We then refined our ideas and gave us a template to put together a pitch In the studio we all came together with our ideas and brainstormed several concepts in which we could help someone in the snow lost using a user interface. We came up with 4 main ideas and broadened them you the different features they could have. They were the user interface for the ski patrol to find the person, the user interface for the people who is lost using a delivery, first aid drone, the autonomous snow mobile that comes and picks up the lost, injury people and takes them to safety of the drone that surveys the land for the ski patrol to have a safe route. Then we all each choose a concept to create story boards and wireframes for. I choose the first aid delivery and companion drone. I started to sketch and annotate using the technique shown in the lecture the storyboard. I found a series of aspect challenging. Firstly, how the drone finds the person, does it fly around surveying and detects someone in trouble but that wasn’t precise in finding the individual? Does the lost skier press a button to send help but then what would happen if the person can’t move? Or is there that the Drones gets a signal without the person having to do anything but how would it get a signal? Secondly, it was challenging in how the drone will get a first kit to match their needs of the user or what will the drone do once it finds the person. I came up with the idea that the drones will receive a signal from the users lift pass when it hasn’t moved for a while or when it is out of the resort and will fly to the user. The drone will fly down and ask if the person needs assistance because the user might not want help and if they do then fly don’t and give the user the interface while it stays there until the ski patrol comes.

                <p>WEEK 6 - In the lecture, we learnt about User interface design patterns and why they are useful. We viewed different websites design patterns like BBC and Commonwealth Bank and seen they components. In the tutorial, we did activities that evolved around paper prototypes which are user-centred design methods for designer to create user friendly software. Paper prototyping is a low-fidelity and is good for quickly validating design before going to digital prototypes. It is used to refine concepts in the earlier stages. In the tutorial, we learnt how to test the prototype and who is best to test on to make sure that the tasks for the user interface is successfully achieved. We then create our own prototypes, the tutorial helping defined each task required when doing the prototype. In the studio, I sketched various different of designs patterns to see what one is the best one and efficient one (PROTOTYPING) </p>

We learnt about the different types of prototyping and why it is important (because it makes the idea tangible, something that we can get user insight from reactions and enhancing the understanding). Prototyping is good for experiment from the feedback and iterate the feedback to explore alternate solutions. In the tutorial, we recreated using pen and paper to the Instagram interface design. We then put our low fidelity sketches into the app pop to create an interactive prototype. After we leanrt how to use pop, we used the design tool sketch to create an Instagram page then putting it into invision to create an online prototype In the studio - USING POP TO PUT LOW PROTOTYPE IN DEVICE USERTESTING </p>
